            <p>
                
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
                services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require 
                a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates
                websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a
                conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
                those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:

                experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or
                membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. <br>
